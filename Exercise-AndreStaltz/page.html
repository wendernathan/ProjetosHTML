        Hi, I come from Brazil, but never felt like a true Brazilian. 
        Now, I live in Finland, where it's nice and cold. The Finnish
         culture also matches my personality well.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently work as an independent contractor, programming 
        instructor, speaker, and donation-based open source developer. 
        From 2013 to 2017 I worked as a Senior Web and Mobile 
        Developer at Futurice. Prior to that, I worked on my own startup 
        during one year building web discussion forum software.

        I'm enthusiastic about reactive programming, functional 
        programming, frontend, mobile, and the decentralized web. 
        I have authored the Cycle.js framework, and have been a core 
        contributor to RxJS. Currently, I am helping build an open 
        source peer-to-peer social network with Scuttlebutt, while 
        supporting my existing open source libraries like Cycle.js 
        and others.
    </p>

        I'm MSc in Computer Science, and for my Master's Thesis I 
        developed HAcid, a Java client library that enables ACID 
        transactions on HBase. In Brazil I graduated BSc in 
        Computational Mathematics at UFMG, where I got to do research 
        on Computational Fluid Dynamics and also Operations Research.

        I started programming by making games. With my friend Glauber 
        Kotaki (artist for Rogue Legacy) I've made some games such as 
        Cold Tension, and by myself I've made RGBlend, a color puzzle 
        game.

        I'm an acoustic guitarist and a composer. I listen to different 
        genres, but mostly instrumental music. Check out my acoustic 
        songs recorded on video. In 2004-2006 I recorded a progressive 
        alternative rock/metal album called O vazio tem um nome. You can 
        find other compositions at Soundcloud.

        Staltz is just a nickname I use on the web since 2004. My real 
        name is <b>André Medeiros</b>, but I try to avoid it because 
        it's disappointingly unoriginal.
