            <span class="risc">ABOUT ME</span>

            <p class="txt">Hi, I come from Brazil, but never felt like a true Brazilian. Now, I live in Finland, where it's nice and cold. The Finnish culture also matches my personality well.</p>

            <p class="txt">I currently work as an independent contractor, programming instructor, speaker, and donation-based open source developer. From 2013 to 2017 I worked as a Senior Web and Mobile Developer at <a href="https://www.futurice.com/">Futurice</a>. Prior to that, I worked on my own startup during one year building web discussion forum software. </p>

            <p class="txt">I'm enthusiastic about reactive programming, functional programming, frontend, mobile, and the decentralized web. I have authored the <a href="https://cycle.js.org/">Cycle.js</a>  framework, and have been a core contributor to <a href="http://reactivex.io/">RxJS</a>. Currently, I am helping build an open source peer-to-peer social network with <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/">Scuttlebutt</a>, while supporting my existing open source libraries like Cycle.js and others. </p>

            <p class="txt"> <a href="http://users.ics.aalto.fi/desoua1/">I'm MSc</a> in Computer Science, and for my <a href="http://users.ics.aalto.fi/desoua1/HAcid_Thesis.pdf">Master's Thesis</a> I developed <a href="https://bitbucket.org/staltz/hacid/wiki/Home">HAcid</a>, a Java client library that enables ACID transactions on <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</a>. In Brazil I graduated BSc in Computational Mathematics at <a href="https://www.ufmg.br/english/">UFMG</a>, where I got to do research on Computational Fluid Dynamics and also <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571065310000041">Operations Research</a>. </p>

            <p class="txt">I started programming by making games. With my friend <a href="http://glauberkotaki.com/">Glauber Kotaki</a> (artist for Rogue Legacy) I've made some games such as <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/cold-tension">Cold Tension</a>, and by myself I've made <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/STALTZ/rgblend">RGBlend</a>, a color puzzle game. </p>

            <p class="txt">I'm an acoustic guitarist and a composer. I listen to different genres, but mostly instrumental music. Check out my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24A51E95B3F5E4D2">acoustic songs recorded on video</a>. In 2004-2006 I recorded a progressive alternative rock/metal album called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/andrestaltz/sets/o-vazio-tem-um-nome">O vazio tem um nome</a>. You can find other compositions at <a href="http://soundcloud.com/andrestaltz">Soundcloud</a>. </p>

            <p class="txt">Staltz is just a nickname I use on the web since 2004. My real name is <b>André Medeiros</b>, but I try to avoid it because it's <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=andr%C3%A9+medeiros">disappointingly unoriginal</a>. </p>
